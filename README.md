# ConvFilters
I started this project to practice making GUI desktop apps with Qt. 
It provides a UI for some code I wrote as coursework for a class on digital image processing.
It will allow you to open and view a .png image, create a filter to convolve it with, apply the filter, view the resulting image, and save it. 

NOTE: I know this READE is a bit sparse. I'll fill it in more once I have the project idea flushed out a bit better. I figured it's best to start with some 

## Getting Started
Clone the repository if you want to take a look at the project. 

## Prerequisites
To work on this project you will need to install Qt and Qt Creator 4.9.1.

## License
Since I'm using opensource version of Qt, I guess this project needs to adhere to their  open source licence requirements, which are available for review here: https://www.qt.io/licensing// 
The Qt framework is available under GPL open source licencese. All other work/code used in this project is under the terms of the MIT license.
